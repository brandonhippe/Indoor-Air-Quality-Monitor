    # The setParameter<txPower> command sets the mote conducted RF output power. Refer to product datasheets for supported RF output power values. For example, if the mote has a typical RF output power of +8 dBm when the Power Amplifier (PA) is enabled, set the txPower parameter to 8 to enable the PA. Similarly, if the mote has a typical RF output power of -2 dBm when the PA is disabled, then set the txPower parameter to -2 to turn off the PA. Note that this value is the RF output power coming out of the mote and not the radiated power coming out of the antenna. This command may be issued at any time and takes effect upon the next transmission.

The default duty cycle enables the mote to join the network at a reasonable rate without using excessive battery power. If you desire a faster join time at the cost of higher power consumption, use the setParameter<joinDutyCycle> command to increase the join duty cycle up to 100%. Note that the setParameter<joinDutyCycle> command is not persistent and stays in effect only until reset. For power consumption information, refer to the mote product datasheet.

    ##
    # The setParameter<service> command is used to request new device-originated bandwidth services and modify existing device-initiated services (now called "Timetables" in WirelessHART 7.4). Calling this command updates the motes internal service table, which later initiates a request to the network manager for bandwidth allocation. A subsequent serviceIndication notification will be sent indicating the response from the network manager. The getParameter<service> command may be used to read the service table, including the state of the service request.
    # 
    # The setParameter<service> command may be sent at any time. If the network manager rejects a service request, the microprocessor can try again by re-issuing the setParameter<service> command.
    # 
    # To delete a service, set the time field of the desired service to zero. Service request flags, application domain, and destination address are ignored by the mote when time equals zero.
    # 
    # Normally all service requests are compared against the power limits set with the setNVParameter<powerInfo> command. Services that would cause the device to exceed its power budget are denied. In Manager 4.1.1, a service request of 1 ms will result in the manager respecting the power limit for publish services, but will allow a block-transfer service requests (see the SmartMesh WirelessHART User's Guide section on Services) that would result in a fast pipe being activated.

    # The send command allows a serial device to send a packet into the network through the mote's serial port. The mote forwards the packet to the network upon receiving it. The microprocessor must not attempt to send data at a rate that exceeds its allocated bandwidth. For a WirelessHART device, the payload of the packet must include the status byte and the extended status byte, followed by one or more sets of HART commands up to the maximum send payload size, as follows:
    # 
    # Request: Status|Extended Status|Cmd1|Length1|Data1|Cmd2|Length2|Data2... Response: Status|Extended Status|Cmd1|Length1(includes response code)|RC1|Data1|Cmd2|Length2|RC2|Data2...
    # 
    # Prior to sending the payload into the network, the mote caches the value of Status and Extended Status to use in packets it originates locally. The send command is only valid when the mote is in the Operational state. If the mote receives this command when it is not in the Operational state, it returns the error RC_INV_STATE. Note: The serial device can receive a request while the mote is in the process of transition from the Connected state to the Operational state.

    # 
    # - Packet transmission
    # - Continuous modulation
    # - Continuous wave (unmodulated signal)
    # 
    # In a packet transmission test, the mote generates a repeatCnt number of packet sequences. Each sequence consists of up to 10 packets with configurable size and delays. Each packet starts with a PHY preamble (5 bytes), followed by a PHY length field (1 byte), followed by data payload of up to 125 bytes, and finally a 2-byte 802.15.4 CRC at the end. Byte 0 of the payload contains stationId of the sender. Bytes 1 and 2 contain the packet number (in big-endian format) that increments with every packet transmitted. Bytes 3..N contain a counter (from 0..N-3) that increments with every byte inside payload. Transmissions occur on the set of channels defined by chanMask , selected inpseudo-randomorder.
    # 
    # In a continuous modulation test, the mote generates continuous pseudo-random modulated signal, centered at the specified channel. The test is stopped by resetting the mote.
    # 
    # In a continuous wave test, the mote generates an unmodulated tone, centered at the specified channel. The test tone is stopped by resetting the mote.
    # 
    # The testRadioTxExt command may only be issued when the mote is in Idle mode, prior to its joining the network. The mote must be reset (either hardware or software reset) after radio tests are complete and prior to joining.
    # 
    # The station ID is a user selectable value. It is used in packet tests so that a receiver can identify packets from this device in cases where there may be multiple tests running in the same radio space.

    # 
    # For LTC5800-WHM based products, driving the TIMEn pin low (assert) wakes the processor. The pin must asserted for a minimum of t strobe s. De-asserting the pin latches the time, and a timeIndication will be generated within t response ms. Refer to the LTC5800-WHM Datasheet for additional information about TIME pin usage.
    # 
    # The processor will remain awake and drawing current while the TIMEn pin is asserted. To avoid drawing excess current, take care to minimize the duration of the TIMEn pin being asserted past t strobe minimum.

If the time field contains the value 0x07FFFFFF , the manager is unable to sustain the service due to network conditions and has effectively disabled the service. The service is not removed, however, and the microprocessor can elect to either delete the service or submit a request to update the service at a future time.
