The nearest appropriate value varies depending on the hardware and calibration. The getParameter<txPower> command will return the value selected by the radio driver.

Similarly, if the part has a typical RF output power of 0 dBm when the PA is disabled, then set the txPower parameter to 0 to turn off the PA. Similarly, calling this function with a value of 10 on a part, such as the LTC-5800, that supports a maximum of +8 dBm will result in a setting of +8.

    # The testRadioTxExt command allows the microprocessor to initiate a radio transmission test. This command may only be issued prior to the mote joining the network. Three types of transmission tests are supported:
    # 
    # - Packet transmission
    # - Continuous modulation
    # - Continuous wave (unmodulated signal)
    # 
    # In a packet transmission test, the mote generates a repeatCnt number of packet sequences. Each sequence consists of up to 10 packets with configurable size and delays. Each packet starts with a PHY preamble (5 bytes), followed by a PHY length field (1 byte), followed by data payload of up to 125 bytes, and finally a 2-byte 802.15.4 CRC at the end. Byte 0 of the payload contains stationId of the sender. Bytes 1 and 2 contain the packet number (in big-endian format) that increments with every packet transmitted. Bytes 3..N contain a counter (from 0..N-3) that increments with every byte inside payload. Transmissions occur on the set of channels defined by chanMask , selected inpseudo-randomorder.
    # 
    # In a continuous modulation test, the mote generates continuous pseudo-random modulated signal, centered at the specified channel. The test is stopped by resetting the mote.
    # 
    # In a continuous wave test, the mote generates an unmodulated tone, centered at the specified channel. The test tone is stopped by resetting the mote.
    # 
    # The testRadioTxExt command may only be issued when the mote is in Idle mode, prior to its joining the network. The mote must be reset (either hardware or software reset) after radio tests are complete and prior to joining.
    # 
    # The station ID is a user selectable value. It is used in packet tests so that a receiver can identify packets from this device in cases where there may be multiple tests running in the same radio space. This field is not used for CM or CW tests. See testRadioRX (SmartMesh IP) or testRadioRxExt (SmartMesh WirelessHART).

    # Send a packet into the network without joining. The mote searches for a network and sends the packet. Optionally, the list of neighbors discovered during the search process is also sent, up to a maximum of four neighbors. If the discovered neighbor list is not included, the payload maximum size is 73B, and if the discovered neighbors are included, the maximum size is 58B.
    # 
    # Upon receiving a blink command, the mote will transition to the blink state and start searching for advertisements. When it hears an advertisement, it synchronizes and continues listening briefly in efforts to discover more neighbors. After this short timeout, the mote immediately sends the data packet to one of the discovered neighbors. If the blink command is called repeatedly to send consecutive packets, the mote does not search again unless the discovered neighbor list is requested.
    # 
    # When the mote successfully sends the packet, a txDone notification will be sent with status set to 0. If the mote cannot send the packet, e.g. if 60 seconds elapse without receiving a MAC-layer acknowledgement, a txDone notification is sent with status set to 1.
    # 
    # For Blink packets, the mote can only accept a single packet at a time. To send multiple packets, the application must wait for the txDone notification. The mote will return to low-power sleep when 60 seconds elapse without any MAC-layer acknowledgements, so to prevent the mote from sleeping, the application should send the packets much faster than this 60 second timeout. See the SmartMesh Embedded IP Manager API Guide for details on the manager-side blink notification.
    # 
    # The mote will stay in the blink state unless it is reset, OR a join command is issued. This was done so that the getTime command can be called at any time after at least one blink packet has been sent. Note that the clock is free-running since its last packet sent and will drift, however can be used as a relatively accurate clock source for many applications, if sending packets once a day for example.

    # For LTC5800-IPM based products, driving the TIMEn pin low (assert) wakes the processor. The pin must asserted for a minimum of t strobe s. De-asserting the pin latches the time, and a timeIndication will be generated within t response ms. Refer to the LTC5800-IPM Datasheet for additional information about TIME pin usage. The processor will remain awake and drawing current while the TIMEn pin is asserted. To avoid drawing excess current, take care to minimize the duration of the TIMEn pin being asserted past t strobe minimum.
